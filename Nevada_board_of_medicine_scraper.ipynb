Ms. Atkins was licensed to practice respiratory care in the state of Nevada in Active-Probation status.  2. On September 10, 2010, the Board approved and adopted a Settlement, Waiver and Consent Agreement with Ms. Atkins in order to resolve pending disciplinary charges filed against her  3. The Settlement, Waiver and Consent Agreement revoked Ms. Atkins' license to practice respiratory care, but stayed the revocation and placed her on probation for a period of 48 months with various terms and conditions of probation.  4. The terms and conditions of probation included Ms. Atkins' agreement that she would submit to random hair or urine screens as required by the Board.  On January 27, 2011, Ms. Atkins was requested to submit to a hair and urine screen.  5. On February 3, 2011, results from said screens were received which indicated that Ms. Atkins had tested positive for methamphetamine as well as codeine and hydrocodone in her hair and Tramadol in her urine. The Investigative Committee believed that due to Ms. Atkins' use of an illegal narcotic substance, specifically methamphetamine, along with other narcotic substances, and being licensed to provide respiratory care, that the health, safety and welfare of the public was at imminent risk of harm and that a summary suspension of her license to practice respiratory care was necessary to remove said risk of imminent harm to the health, safety and welfare of the public. Accordingly, pursuant to NRS 630.326(1):  The Investigative Committee ordered that Ms. Atkins' license to practice respiratory care in the state of Nevada be suspended until further order of the Investigative Committee or Board and that the matter be heard on March 11, 2011 at 9:30 a.m., concurrently with the hearing set regarding the Order to Show Cause filed on February 4, 2011 in the matter, to determine the appropriateness of the suspension, unless the parties mutually agree to a longer period of time pursuant to NRS 630.326. </span></li>\n",

The Board found that the costs associated with Count Two were the same as those associated with Count One, as both Counts were based upon the unlicensed practice of medicine and both Counts required the same investigation. Therefore, the Board found that the dismissal of Count Two did not change the costs associated with Count One. It was ordered that the fine of $500.00, previously imposed by the Board's Order filed 12-11-98, was confirmed as the appropriate penalty on Count One and was to be paid within 30 days of this Order if it had not already been paid. The public reprimand ordered in the previous Order of 12-11-98 was confirmed as having been issued.

Dr. Swaine tested positive for controlled substances in May, July and October of 2007, and his positive test in October of 2007 occurred while he was on leave from his out-of-state treatment program. Dr. Swaine practiced medicine surreptitiously after being told not to practice by Dr. Peter A. Mansky, Executive Medical Director of the Nevada Professionals Health Program (\"NPHP\"), pursuant to the terms of Dr. Swaine's NPHP agreement, in October of 2007, while he was on leave from his out-of-state program. Dr. Swaine managed to obtain leaves of absence from his out-of-state program to return to Las Vegas on two separate occasions, and the Board was concerned that he may do so again and practice medicine again, against the professional advice of the Executive Medical Director of NPHP and Respondent poses a risk to the health, safety and welfare of the public and the patients he sees and treats. Pursuant to NRS 630.329, the Board ORDERED that Dr. Swaine's license to practice medicine in Nevada be suspended pending proceedings for disciplinary action pursuant to the Complaint filed against him, or until further order of the Board. </span></li>\n",

Therefore, Dr. Horne's conduct fell below the appropriate standard of care, as he failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used by a like practitioner in similar circumstances. The Board ordered that Dr. Horne be issued a formal written public letter of reprimand from the Board; that he be fined in the amount of $2,500; that he begin evaluation and monitoring, on at least a monthly basis, within thirty (30) days of the acceptance, adoption and approval of the Settlement Agreement and this evaluation and monitoring is to continue for a period of eighteen (18) months after its inception, with quarterly written reports regarding his status being submitted by the evaluator. Dr. Horne acknowledges that his active medical licensure in the state of Nevada is contingent upon his completion of the eighteen (18)-month evaluation and monitoring process and that his failure to comply with the aforementioned evaluation and monitoring terms will result in his medical license being summarily suspended for failure to comply with an order of the Board.
